## Recommendations for BandHub

### Features to Prioritize (MVP)
1. **Real-time group chat** - Missing from all band management apps
2. **Event calendar with RSVP** - Core need, must be simple
3. **Discussion threads** - For async topics (gear, song ideas)
4. **Announcements** - Admin posts with reactions
5. **Simple onboarding** - Invite via email, accept in one click

### Features to Defer (Post-MVP)
1. Setlist builder - BandHelper does this well
2. Finance tracking - Complex, Back On Stage excels here
3. Contract/invoice generation - Business feature, not social
4. Stage plots - Niche professional need
5. MIDI/lighting control - Very niche

### Competitive Positioning
- **Not**: A complex business tool for professional bands
- **Is**: A simple, modern communication hub for any band
- **Tagline idea**: "Slack for bands" or "Your band's home base"

### Pricing Strategy
- Free tier with core features (1 band, limited history)
- Pro tier at $5-10/month for multiple bands, full history
- Position as significantly cheaper than $34/month average
