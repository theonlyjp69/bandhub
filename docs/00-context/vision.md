# BandHub Vision

## What is BandHub?

**BandHub** is a web application that helps bands manage communication, events, and coordination in one unified platform. Instead of juggling multiple apps (group chats, calendars, file sharing, spreadsheets), band members have one place for everything.

**Think:** Slack + Google Calendar + Trello, but built specifically for bands.

## Problem Statement

Musicians in bands struggle with coordination across multiple disconnected tools:
- Group texts/WhatsApp for communication
- Google Calendar/Calendly for scheduling
- Google Drive/Dropbox for file sharing
- Spreadsheets for tracking shows and finances
- Email for formal band communications

This fragmentation leads to:
- Missed rehearsals and shows
- Lost files and versions
- Communication gaps
- Scheduling conflicts
- Administrative overhead for band leaders

## Solution

BandHub consolidates all band coordination into a single, purpose-built platform:

| Need | BandHub Feature |
|------|-----------------|
| Scheduling | Events with RSVPs, availability polling |
| Communication | Real-time chat, discussion threads, announcements |
| File Sharing | Centralized storage for setlists, recordings, stems |
| Coordination | Band membership, invitations, role management |

## Target Users

**Primary:** Casual to semi-professional bands (3-8 members)
- Cover bands
- Original projects
- Worship teams
- Community music groups

**User Personas:**
- **Band Leader/Manager:** Organizes the group, creates events, posts announcements
- **Band Member:** RSVPs to events, participates in discussions, shares files

## Competitive Position

**Simple, modern band coordination tool:**
- Not as complex as BandHelper or Back On Stage
- Purpose-built for bands (unlike Discord or group texts)
- Modern, dark-themed UI (Linear-inspired)
- Free to start, built on Supabase/Vercel free tiers

## Success Metrics

1. A user can sign in and create a band within 2 minutes
2. Band members can coordinate an event in under 5 clicks
3. Real-time chat messages appear in < 1 second
4. App works seamlessly on mobile browsers
5. Zero cost to run for small bands (free tier)

## Future Vision (Post-MVP)

- Finance tracking (income, expenses, splits)
- Setlist builder with song database
- Public band pages for promotion
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Direct messages (1:1)
- Integration with streaming platforms
